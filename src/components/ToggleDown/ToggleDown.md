Toggle Down:
```js
<Toggle>
{({ on, toggle }) => (
  <div>
    <Button onClick={toggle}>Trigger</Button>
    <ToggleDown on={on} toggle={toggle}>
      <h3>Toggle Town</h3>
      <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. </p>
    </ToggleDown>
  </div>
)}
</Toggle>
```
